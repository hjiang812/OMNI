This repository hosts the open-sourced resource corresponding to our article: A 1024-channel 583-nW/ch Spike-Sorting SoC with Sparsity-Aware Spike Detection Scratchpad and Ultra-Low-Leakage Dual-Voltage 5T-SRAM for 16K-Template Clustering. It includes:

(1) Example snippet of our neural recordings, along with the software configuration used to synthesize the 1024-channel dataset.

(2) On-chip algorithm for selecting the hottest/coldest templates

🚧 This project is under active development.
